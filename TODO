get test data:
   spSpec example
   spAll example for same
   deep subsample
   galex subsample
   galex+SDSS subsample
   twomass+SDSS subsample
   synthesized across all z?
write and test:
   sdss_kcorrect
   deep_kcorrect
   galex_kcorrect
   twomass_kcorrect
check metallicities
check stellar masses
create many primer data sets
create the full data set
make sure vmatrix/lambda stuff works fine
run on full

clean up TODO:

new docs:
  which calib for eisenstein k_sdssfix
  clarify issue with color edges
