test DEEP data:
   make deep_kcorrect
   make residual plot 
   make sdss2deep 
   make deep2sdss 
   make deep2bessell 
   make deep-like sample
   run deep_kcorrect and sdss_kcorrect, check consistency
other
   make bessell2sdss 
   make sdss2bessell 
   
   

check consistency of fit across redshiift at low z
check predictability of FNKs
get test data:
   deep subsample
   galex subsample
   galex+SDSS subsample
   twomass+SDSS subsample
   synthesized across all z?
write and test:
   sdss_kcorrect
   deep_kcorrect
   galex_kcorrect
   twomass_kcorrect
check metallicities
check stellar masses
make sure vmatrix/lambda stuff works fine
run on full

clean up TODO:

new docs:
  which calib for eisenstein k_sdssfix
  clarify issue with color edges
  how to calculate corrections from one band to another using
   reconstruct_maggies
