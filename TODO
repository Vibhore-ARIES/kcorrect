NOTES:

note dependence on idlutils
better notes on how to calc kcorrection using reconstruct_maggies
sawtooth behavior --- diagnose

recommendation for use of JHK?? -- use v5_4
2MASS photometry checks
switch to v5_4 (at level of vagc, though)
photo-z efficiency (don't always restart iteration)
test IMFs
Charlot templates?
back out stellar masses?
evolution estimates
add python
