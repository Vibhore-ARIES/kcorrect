\caption{\label{spur} The spectrum corresponding to the direction of
the spur in the upper right panel of Figure
\ref{k_coeffdist_plot}. Note the strong feature near 4000
\AA. Overplotted are the bandpasses for $\band{0.3}{g}$ and
$\band{0.3}{r}$. The strong features fall in the gap between the
bandpasses. Thus, in a linear fit to a galaxy at $z=0.3$, this
component can be used to fit the observed magnitudes without being
constrained to have reasonable behavior around 4000 \AA. }

\caption{\label{k_coeffdist_plot} {\it Top panels}: Distribution of
the components of the four-parameter fit to the five-band SDSS
photometry for a random subsample consisting of 10,000 of the SDSS
galaxies. $a_0$ is linearly proportional to the flux between $3500\AA$
and $7000\AA$, while $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$ contribute no flux in
this range. Thus, the ratios $a_1/a_0$, $a_2/a_0$, and $a_3/a_0$
describe the spectral type of the galaxy. $a_1/a_0$ is the most
variable parameter and thus is the better separator of galaxy
type. The spur extending from the upper left to the lower right from
the red dot in the $(a_3/a_0)$-$(a_1/a_0)$ plane is due to a
degeneracy for galaxies at $z\sim 0.3$, described in detail in Section
\ref{grgap}. {\it Bottom panel}: At fixed $a_2/a_0$ and $a_3/a_0$, the
inferred spectra corresponding to various values of $a_3/a_0$. Near
$a_3/a_0=-0.20$, the spectrum is similar to that of an elliptical
galaxy. For higher values, the spectrum becomes bluer. }

\caption{\label{k_model_plot} Reconstructed galaxy fluxes relative to
the observed galaxy fluxes, for all five SDSS bands, shown for a
random subsample consisting of around 10,000 of the SDSS galaxies. The
residuals are shown against redshift.  There is no systematic trend
with redshift in any band. The 5-$\sigma$ clipped estimate of the
scatter around the observed fluxes is listed for each band. In $u$,
$g$, $r$, and $i$ the scatter is consistent with the expected
photometric errors in the survey at all redshifts. At high redshift
the scatter in $z$ becomes large, most likely due to increasing
photometric errors. }

volume limited) for $0.05<z<0.17$. Left panels show the colors as a
function of redshift. Right panel shows the distributions of each
color at high and low redshift within the volume-limited
subsample. The observed colors clearly depend strongly on redshift,

$z=0.3$.  The redshift dependence is greatly reduced for the LRGs in
comparison to Figure \ref{lrg_colors_plot.z}; on the other hand, there
are distinct trends of restframe color with redshift.  In
$\band{0.3}{(g-r)}$ an overall trend is apparent; LRGs at $z=0.4$ are
about 0.1 magnitudes bluer than LRGs at $z=0.2$. A change of this
magnitude is attributable to passive galaxy evolution, though
considerably more work needs to be done to show that this is
occurring. In $\band{0.3}{(r-i)}$, a blueward shift also occurs,
though at a much smaller level.}

function of redshift in all five bands for a random subsample
consisting around 10,000 of the SDSS galaxies.  The range of
$K$-corrections at each redshift reflects the range of galaxy types at
each redshift.  The $K$-corrections are largest, and therefore the
most uncertain, for the \band{0.3}{u} and \band{0.3}{g} bands. While
we show the $K$-corrections for \band{0.3}{u} at $z<0.3$ and for
\band{0.3}{z} at $z>0.3$, and indeed these $K$-corrections are fairly
well-behaved, we do not recommend using these extrapolated results for
scientific purposes. Note the degeneracy at $z=0.3$.}
