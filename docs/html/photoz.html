<H1> Photometric Redshifts</H1>
 
<p> Once one has constructed the SED templates, it is trivial to use
them to calculate photometric redshifts. One cannot fit all four
templates to the data plus the redshift -- there just is not enough
information. Instead, one has to settle for fitting only two templates
-- one which estimates the flux and one which estimates the color. The
photometric redshift templates we use ("defaultpz" in the
$KCORRECT_DIR/data/etemplates directory) use the most principal axis
(e_3) from the full 4D fit as the color direction. </p>

<p> Fitting photometric redshifts just requires fitting the two
coefficients for a number of redshifts and minimizing the chi^2
residuals for the fits. I provide routines here to do so. They are
reasonably fast -- about 1 ms an object on a 1GHz Pentium III -- and
reasonably accurate -- the 5-sigma clipped estimate of the redshift
errors is about 0.05. </p>

<p> The IDL routine <b>kphotoz</b> works in a way which is extremely
similar to the <b>kcorrect</b> routine.
<pre>
kphotoz, galaxy_mag, galaxy_magerr, photoz, [, coeffs=, $
    /maggies, version=, vpath=, rmatrix=, ematrix=, zvals=]
</pre>
For example, one might do the following:
<pre>
kphotoz, [0., 2., 0.7, 0.3, 0.3], [0.02,0.02,0.02,0.02,0.02], photoz 
</pre>
</p>
Again, there is large overhead, so one-at-a-time is not the way to
call <b>kphotoz</b>. As for <b>kcorrect</b>, you can avoid spending
this overhead more than once either by feeding it lists of objects or
as follows:
kphotoz, [0., 2., 0.7, 0.3, 0.3], [0.02,0.02,0.02,0.02,0.02], $
    photoz, rmatrix=rmatrix, ematrix=ematrix, zvals=zvals
kphotoz, [0., 1.7, 0.8, 0.2, 0.2], [0.02,0.02,0.02,0.02,0.02], $
    photoz, rmatrix=rmatrix, ematrix=ematrix, zvals=zvals

<p> The stand-alone program <b>fit_photoz</b> works in the same way as
<b>fit_coeffs</b>: 
<pre>
cat maggies.dat | fit_photoz $KCORRECT_DIR/data/etemplates/ematrix.defaultpz.dat \
   $KCORRECT_DIR/data/etemplates/bmatrix.defaultpz.dat \
   $KCORRECT_DIR/data/etemplates/lambda.defaultpz.dat \
   $KCORRECT_DIR/data/etemplates/filterlist.defaultpz.dat 
</pre>
where in this case each line of "maggies.dat" has the form:
<pre>
umaggies gmaggies rmaggies imaggies zmaggies uinvvar ginvvar rinvvar iinvvar zinvvar
</pre>
The output is again to standard out and is of the form:
<pre>
coeff0 coeff1 photoz
</pre>
</p>

<p> The photo-z code can also be accessed through the C library
libkcorrect.so. Follow the directions in the <a href="index.html">
main page</a> for using this library. Instead of <b>k_fit_coeffs</b>,
you will be calling <b>k_fit_photoz</b>, as in:
<pre>
k_fit_photoz(ematrix,nt,zvals,nz,rmatrix,nk,nb,coeffs,galaxy_flux,
             galaxy_invvar,galaxy_photoz,ngalaxy);
</pre>
Remember that galaxy_flux and galaxy_invvar are expressed in maggies
</p>

<p> Please note that the photometric redshifts resulting from this
code are not in any sense "official" SDSS photometric redshifts. In
addition, they should be used with due regard to the correlations
between errors in type and errors in redshift, as well as the
systematic errors associated with photometric redshifts. </p>

<p> Finally, this code can be (almost) trivially adapted to
any optical photometry results for galaxies in the redshift range 0 to
0.5. All you need to do is to put different filters into the
filterlist file, make sure your magnitudes are AB, and plug away!</p>
