This directory contains a number of filter responses 
from different astronomical instruments. Most of them include 
atmosphere. They are fully explained in their header documentation,
as is the format of the files. 

At this time, 2MASS, SDSS, and UK Schmidt filter curves are included.

Remember, the absolute values of the responses are arbitrary.
