# Instrument: Hypothetical system developed to match known "standards"
#             of Johnson/Cousins to spectrophotometry

# Determined by: M. S. Bessell

# Notes:
#
# These filter curves define the "official" Johnson/Cousins BVRI
# system, as far # as I am concerned. One must take care to make sure
# that you really want these filters; ie. that the observations have
# been converted into this system. Otherwise, you will have to use
# custom filter curves (which may not be a bad idea).

#
# Read it; it will give you a good insight into how complex this 
# whole business really is.
